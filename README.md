# Landing Page

Real-world project from [Front End Web Developer](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011) at Udacity.

A multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

## Goals

This project aims to give us real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. We’ll be building a landing page that combines our skills with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to update and control the page and create a dynamic user experience. The functionality we will be using serves two purposes: to prepare us for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site.

## Features

- Dynamically create a navigation menu based on the sections of the page.
- Clicking on a navigation item will scroll to the appropriate section of the page.
- While navigating through the page, the section that is active in the viewport/closest to the top will be distinguished from the other sections.
- Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it will still be present on page load).
- Keep showing navigation bar when hovering the mouse over it.
- There's a scroll to the top button on the page that’s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
- Collapsible sections.
- A responsive landing page that can be used across all devices, such as modern desktops, tablets, and phone browsers.

## Requirements

We will be building a multi-section landing page. Often times, we won’t know how much content will be added to a page through a Content Management System (CSM) or an API. To handle this problem, we will dynamically add content to the page. We will be demonstrating this with the navigation menu.

To improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed should be differentiated in some way. Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item should scroll us to the appropriate section rather than giving us the default jump.
